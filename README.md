## **AFTERPAY PROFILE**
AFTERPAY was one of the Australian Fintech unicorn before it was acquired by the Block Inc, FKA Square, the company behind Twitter prior Elon Musk's acquisition of the platform. The company that was once publicly-traded in ASX market was established in late 2014 and founded by Nick Molnar and Anthony Eisen in Sydney, Australia. Fast forward to 2021, the company had 3 million active users and thousands of retail partners from across Australia and the globe - indicating a revolutionary mass adoption at a fiery growth. The company's revenue is derived from **unique digital payment service**. As suggested from its brand name, the company allow customers to **'pay later'** upon their purchases of product or service.

 During the economic collapse in COVID-19 pandemic, this buy-now-pay-later has been acquired at a value of A$39 billion by the US Company under management of Jack Dorsey (founder of Twitter) and it soon become the largest M&A deal in Australia's history. Before this historic deal, the AFTERPAY Ltd (aka ASX: APT) stock is the centre of attention in Australian market exchange. The amazing run of AFTERTPAY stock price movement had the market divided in different kinds of emotion - celebratingly happy, stunned and regretfully dissapointed. APT stock firsly issued in 2016 at a price of $1 (raising $25 million) and peaked at around $150 during early 2021. While the ride seems ever-increasingly streamlined in the big picture, but the actuality is the stock has encountered many extreme ups and downs.

## **AFTERPAY's Idea Origin**

Afterpay's co-founders, **Anthony Eisen** (47 years old) and **Nick Molner** (30 years old) started the company in late 2014. Go further toward the past, the two founders were once neighbors in Sydney. Nick was working for his parent's jewelry store and starting his luck to sell excess jewelry on ebay. After graduation, Nick worked for equity firm Carnegie & Co during the da and packing jewelry at night. Anthony right then was CIO at Guinness Peat Group and former investment banker at Credit Suisse. Living closely, Anthony who worked late at night often see Nick's light also on during the night. From there, Anthony struck a conversation on working at night and a friendship was built. Nick's business allow him to understand the issue in ecommerce firsthand -from low conversion rates and the shift in new generation was of shopping toward debit for daily purchases, then insights were shared between the two and light bulb moments sparked.

## **Business Value** ##


**Numbers at Glance**

1. Operates in 52 countries (highest number in US and Australia)
2. 100,000+ merchant partners
3. 16 million+ global customers
4. 73% of its total customers is millenials


**Business Model**

![Business_Model](Business_Model.JPG)
1. Afterpay Unit Economics Model Example: Take a standard $1,000 loan. Charge 4% merchant fee ($40).
This $1,000 can be turned 12x/year since Afterpay’s loans are on average 1 month periods. $40 x 12 =
$480. Less Afterpay’s historical write-offs and other expenses of 2% at 12x or $240 = $240 profit. And
these returns only looked better with leverage!

2. Consumer Lender Model Example: Take a standard $1,000 loan. Charge 18% annualized interest with
2% fees. Turn $1,000 2x/year. $180 + $40 = $210. Less write-offs of 2% for 2x or (-$40) = $180 profit

Afterpay revenue stream comes from two streams: merchant revenue and late fees - customers are not charged for services unless they incur late fees. The merchant costs 4% of total sales. Late fees cost $10 in the first week and $7 after the second week; these fees accounted for 10% of total income. The repayment process goes for four payments occured fornightly. Even if a late fee is charged at Afterpay, it is likely a lower-cost option than using credit card financing and is capped at 25% of the total order value. 

**Technology behind Afterpay**

According to Crunchbase, Afterpay uses 48 technology product and services including HTML5, jQuery, and Google Analytics. Afterpay is actively using 73 technologies for its website, according to BuiltWith, including Viewport Meta, Iphone/ Mobile Compatible and LetsEncrypt.

**All *WIN* Solution**

"We are focused on supporting our community of shoppers. We trust in the next generation and share a vision of a more accessible and sustainable world in which people are rewarded for doing the right thing. Afterpay's mission is to power an economy in which everyone wins".

-Merchant: Afterpay delivers higher conversion rate by eliminating potential customer's indecision or boost confidence, increase cart size, automate upfront payment, and reduce refunds.

-Customer: enable customer to defer payment leading to budgeting management, increase cash availability (time value of money) and reduce the guilty feeling of large purchases.

-Afterpay: as sales increases, Afterpay generate more revenue and take advantage of word of mouth marketing or growing network effects.

**Marketing**

![ads](ads.webp)

Long story short, the strong value proposition and high urgency of the services win the battle for Afterpay. But pyramid is not made overnight, Afterpay had its struggle in its early days to convince customer for its secure privacy and data while ensuring to merchants that payments will be paid in full corresponding procedure. 

**Unfair Advantage and Management**

1. Powerful and Purposeful Branding

Being the biggest and one of first to emerge in the industry where shopping behaviour rapidly shifted and abundance of resources (goods and services) is undeniably tempting Afterpay is well-positioned to win the already winning race. When it comes to lending, people are inclined to seek validation from biggest company in the space to be held accountable for providing seamless and secured transaction. Furthermore, global study has surveyed over 8,000 global consumers and 75 companies and find that a well understood purpose of brand lead to strong business benerift with consumers are **four times more likely to buy and recommend to other about these purposeful companies**.

2. Modern Bank (non-interest lending)

Buy Now Pay Later is a game changer to shopping experience. It provides fast and convenient payment solution. Firstly, Afterpay is **integrated within the store** - online or in-store; consumers do not have to go through complex payment plans or complete payment in a blink of an eye. Secondly, unlike traditional bank, **Afterpay doesn't charge any interest** for each repayments unless a consumer incur late fees, thereby it can be a **effective alternative to credit card**. Lastly, Afterpay doesn't care about customer's credit score. With good risk management, Afterpay allows people with low credit score and building their credit score to have equal right with other shoper. 

3. Risk Management and Demand

We all have seen reckless shopping at least once in our life. And  because of our inner rush to buy something above our capacity, it can be really damaging to ourselves and the company. Nevertheless, the bombardment of ads and promotion leaves no option to customer but being tempted. Two risk managing measures taken by Afterpay are putting limit on spending and age restriction. Only customer aged 18 or more can only spend up to $1,500 in single transaction with outstanding limit in the account limited to $2,000. New customers are demanded to provide identity profile, valid bank card, e-mail and phone number address, and live where the app run (e.g. Australia for Australian).

4. Low customer acquisition and marketing cost

Merchants is willing to pay dollars/ 4% of their sales to increase asset turnover and inventory turnover. Network effect and merchant'S contribution also provide free advertisement for Afterpay. For instance, say merchant X wants to encourage their potential customers to make purchase and increase sales, by providing them with alternative payment (lending) from Afterpay they can practically boost their sales while it is a free marketing and access to customer base for Afterpay. The free interest-rate is the most valuable excuse for customer to use its service.

**Trend in BNPL at a glance**

Several players has shown great plan to intergrate with AI learning.

**Competitors**

1. Klarna 

Starting in 2005 in Sweden, it then went through a revamp in 2015. Similar to Afterpay, customer who make purchase are obliged to make payment in four equal instalment spread over six weeks, first 25% of total purchase (up to $2000) is held on linked debit or credit card as the authorisation amount. It is also interest fee unless there is overdue payment. What makes Klarna different to others is the broad option for shopping. Klarna works with almost every retailers and it is all can be seen through its website that also has wide-range of functionality like wishlist and notification of price drop.

2. Visa

In 2019, the global financial network company has put the BNPL companies under pressure due to its plan to start digital infrastructure in BNPL space. Yet some sources said Afterpay is not under a threat due to its uniques value propostion and customer's loyalty.

3. Affirm

founded by Paypal Co-founder, Max Levchin, in 2012. It has similar business model to Afterpay when it makes appearance in BNPL. The company has struck massive deals with Shopify and Peloton.

----

## **Business Impact** ##

**Issues and Critisms** 

1. Regulatory Issue

Compared to conventional loan, BNPL industry is generally regulated. The complexity of BNPL nature and high demand leaves customer less protected. The BNPL Code of Practice is a voluntary code of conduct developed by the Australian Finance Industry Association (AFIA) for the buy now, pay later (BNPL) industry. The Code sets out best practices and standards for BNPL providers, including providing clear and transparent information to customers, offering fair and flexible repayment options, and protecting customers from potential harm. 

2. Breach of Consumer Usage

There has been growing concern over access to lending. There have been talks among community of shoppers about minors and unworthy of credit consumers can easily get lending services in Afterpay. 

3. Glorification Debt Culture

This statement works differently depending on the one's perception. While BNPL community believed that the industry is doing good for people's budgeting and stimulating the economy for encouraging people to spend more, others deem this process creates a poor core habit by normalizing people, especially youngster, to buy things with other people's money. 

4. Surge in Inflation

Massive layoffs had been performed by many tech companies in this particularly year and the main reason why is the cost of salary rises due to high inflation. For BNPL companies, debt is the main source of their business - therefore having the cost of debt rises will vastly impact the core structure of their business activities. Many suspected that some of these BNPL will not survive to see another year.

**

## **Afterpay Argument** ##

1. Afterpay had applied $7 additional fees if the payment is not current after 7 days and $10 fees if customer repays late.
2. Afterpay had rejected 40% of transaction and 50% first timers.
3. Afterpay argued it helps young generation who lives off minimum salary and provide better budgeting.
4. It also argued that capped lending at $2,000 will not cause dangerous credit risk or as risky as what banks conduct.

----

## **Recommendation** ##

1. Transparency

This topic has been a lingering subject in financial services due to collective concern that arises from potential risks that comes from unconventional lending. First is cyber attack. Transparency can provide clients/ customers composure and earn their trust. Transparency is imperative in every metric from financial report, ability of company to get more fund to conduct lending activities, ability to earning back from lending, and others that can affect the lives of its stakeholder. But since the company is acquired and brought private by the owner, full transparency may not be available.

2. Collaboration among the BNPL companies

Unique business value is inherent to each own's company, but growing as a whole industry is much more beneficially impactful than trying to stand up alone. Up until today we have seen so so many extreme cases of misconduct in financial services. One of them happened recently in fintech space, FTX stock exchange. Due to lack of regulation to keep up with innovation, some of these irreponsible company have chosen the careless path and inflicted billion dollar loss from its customer. Other issue such as cyber attack can also be eliminated if the company put more time on growing collectively instead of competing for bigger market share. 

3. Technology

As mentioned before, some BNPL companies already made a move to Artificial Intelligence to provide better service in lending transactions. I personally believe AI has a future with BNPL industry. AI  itself can be used to determine if the customer is trust worthy to take loan. In fact, I would say BNPL companies including Afterpay are being too generous or ignorant on taking low credited customers that can lead to inefficiency of collecting back the loan. Other than that, if there is one thing technology good at, it is data. Machine learning can be used for its data capability to prevent future loss and solve issue that is commonly shared in BNPL sector. AI and machine learning can also be utilized to predict cost and profit based on their prediction on risk taken and resources in which it helps companies who having tough time in aligning business lending operation and the rise in cost of debt.
